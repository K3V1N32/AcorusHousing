About
-------
Acorus Housing is a bukkit housing plugin that uses worldguard and permissions to make it easier for players to buy apartments/houses and takes some stress of admins/staff for setting up houses for players

How to use
-------

*1. Server staff creates a(n) apartment/house and would like for players to be allowed to buy it, but does not want to have to be on at the same time as the player for the player to purchase the house.
*2. Server staff marks the 'editable' boundries of the house/apartment with worldedits wand (a wooden axe for acorus)
*3. Server staff types /region definr (address)
*4. Server staff establishes an address for the house/apartment
*5. Server staff type: /house reg (address)
*6. The default price is $1000 If the staff wishes the house to be a different price, type: /house forsale (address) (price)
*7. House (address) is registered and ready to be sold! all we need now is a way to sell it =)
*8. Server staff puts down a sign (most likely next to the apartment/house, or in a real estate office) and writes this on it:
Line 1:[houseinfo]
Line 2:(address)
*9. Server staff presses done and then right clicks the sign to 'initialize it', the sign now reads:
Line 1:(address)
Line 2:[forsale]
Line 3:(price)
Line 4:/house buy
*10. The house/apartment is now ready to be bought!
*11. Player finds a house that they want and found the sign that belongs to that house
*12. Player types: /house buy, and left clicks the sign, money is credited and the property is no owned by Player
*13. The sign should now read:
Line 1:(address)
Line 2:Owner:
Line 3:(owner)
*14. Players friend comes onto server and wants to live in friends house with him(moocher!)
*15. Player types /house givekey (address) (player name(moocher in this case))
*16. moocher can now edit blocks/open the door to Players house/apartment
*17. moocher breaks Players couch during a wild party while Player was away
*18. Player uses: /house takekey (address) (player)
*19. moocher is kicked out!
*20. Player moves out
*21. Server staff use /house remove (address) and do steps 2 - 5 over again(sorry for now, the restore command will hopefully be implemented soon!)
*22. house/apartment is available again!
*23. ENJOY!!!!
